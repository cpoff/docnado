This is post #1.

### My Great Heading {#getsome}

Callouts are designed to draw attention to a particular class of information. This is a long information callout with **bold** text and *italic* text too. It is designed to span multiple lines so that you can see how the paragraph will break across the info callout.
{: .info}

Warning style callouts can be added too. Keep them punchy.
{: .warning}

Dangerous warnings go here.
{: .danger}

Take a look at the Markdown file to see how these are implemented.
